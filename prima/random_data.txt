You shoulda seen me, i was walkin around lookin over kids shoulders while they were workin just like him. it was baaaad
Haha Jenelly you lil creeper! Hehe just kidding, I love u too :)
Sorry coach, had a bit of a late start today
Dillon, PLEASE go into great detail on those experiences surfing religion class on Monday!!!
it was quite "foxy"
Kaitlyn, wasnt gonna, thomas did for me though

hahaha. only you would actually shout "Thomas"
I honestly have no words.
Kairos was such an eye opening experience. I truly feel blessed to have had the opportunity to make new friendships, rekindle old ones, and learn a bit about myself too. Thank you everyone who was apart of Kairos 82. LT4
2 days later... Challenge Backfired
some ppl just never grow up ^
Its sarcasm the word fuck is a profainity
woah there, Thomas, we're all Brothers in Christ. Except for Ari, because he's Jewish. (jk)
truth is.. youve always been one of my best friends & thats never gonna change :) i know i can tell you anything, and you always give me the best advice. i love you sooooo much & i dont know what i would do without you <3 we dont talk that much anymore, which makes me sad :( i miss our deep convos.. so we definitely need to have another philosophical talk about life soon. :) lol. p.s. college together? cal poly? i think YES. if we dont, i will CRY.

yess
I need that slipnslide
Thanks! Road trip to Washington this summer perhaps?
Thank you trey

Mines already broken...
I was referring to when you said "diminish the respectability." it's so unnecessarily complicated. Just use simple language. You could've just said "I don't mean to disrespect vegetarianism." you don't have to make things so complicated for no reason
My hair is the only reason I liked them ;) haha I was just about to post on your wall
Devin,y u gotta hate on me?:) I'd be a wonderful doctor
My sentiments exactly...
Katie Molyneux why do you like this?

thats surprising...fox is usually very republican bias...
dubstep sucks
2012... Not too shabby
I can't seem to find this "butt hurt" you're talking about. I call people stupid and ignorant on a regular basis, so that has nothing to do with me being offended
#'MERICA
I'm tempted to get a pair of Sanuks...
yeah Thomas! you have to! mandatory stuff
oh and were gonna move seats
Haha no don't need to I think I'll just give to for christmas!! Since your bday isnt for a while :))
But they are stil words, they do still communicate with people. So they hve to know what the heck they are signing by knowing what the words are and would sound like, so therefore they think in the language that they sign in.
Pretty much sums up the two week emotionally roller coaster caused by birthdays...

I should never do creative writing after midnight, it gets too... creative...
It's such a horrible representation of what you actually learned in the class. Like one student may be understanding it perfectly, but freezes up on tests (cough cough, me) and messes up real bad on it. Subsequently, you get a poopy grade... but that doesn't accurately show what you achieved in the class room. -.- gaaahh school sucks.
There's no arguing with that logic
well i did another hour of running after we finished so it just compunded
Thanks sasha! come home soon!!! :)

What I say: Please close my door What my parents hear: Please leave my door just a crack open so it bothers me extremely to the point where I will eventually get up and close it myself

If you haven't heard of De La Salle (Concord, Calif.) High football coach Bob Ladouceur, perhaps this will add some perspective on his legendary status: Jim Caviezel, the actor who played Jesus in The Passion of the Christ, will portray him in an upcoming film. California's all-time winningest prep ...

How am I an idiot?
That awkward moment when you get called an attention whore and can't deny it...then the awkward moment when you realize you're posting this status just for the attention...
Oh, and Jared, it's just as likely that your lack of realization wasn't an implication of a lack of diversity of friends.

So I finally realized why girls want you to text them first. They just realize that they arenât allowed to speak unless spoken to.
Still counts as messy... it just happens to help you too...

Whats an earthquake?
Hey Brantford! we got Engrish together.
don't tell me you didn't think the same thing when you went through the school facts.
Tony, did u not see that I said it sucked?
no because that isn't what occupy did... they occupied a park.. i just did a 30 min presentation on it I would know
Hey facebook, sorry we haven't talked in a while but I found a bigger addiction than you. It's called Minecraft, maybe you've heard of it. So it looks like we won't be seeing each other too often for the next few months...
oh, shut up.
THOMAS!
so today was a good day for you right?
Hmmmm, I wouldn't expect a female to like this status...
Vote Thomas Franceschi for senior class president
You completely missed the point Josh. I meant the whole comment could've been shortened. And jarrett: I think you're definitely smarter than I am. But you try too hard to sound like it. It's Facebook comments. You come off like a pretentious idiot because you constantly use all these words that don't even make sense in context. They technically make sense from a dictionary standpoint, but not in context. Like the day you told me you couldn't play soccer because "soccer necessitates shorts" rather than just speaking coherently and sayin that you didn't have a pair. That's all.
is it me or is thomas starting to get funny?
Me too, pretty sweet
Thanks Matt
the woodchuck? clever
its great. How's illinois?
That's beside the point...
finally grants on my side!
I think we have it till tomorrow morning... In case anyone would like to join me
